# Artifact Trader Discord Bot

It's a Discord bot that me and my friends intended to use on out D&D sessions but we didn't use it :)

Me and my friends don't want to finish it but you can gather here some nice code 'chunks' that you can use in your project.



## Running

Download latest version

```bash
  python3 main.py
```

and we are ready to go.

All you have to do now is change channels id to your ownand you will be good.

They are on line `12, 13, 123` 
## FAQ

-**How do i add items?**

-All items are stored in `artifacts.json` file, you can clean it up and then use `json-importer.py` to add your own custom items.

-**Why are commits in two languages** 

-It was a private project at first so we mixed languages 

-**I have more questions** 

-Contact me and i'll happily help you
